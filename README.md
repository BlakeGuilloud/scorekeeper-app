## Scorekeeper-app

This project utilizes my [scorekeeper](https://github.com/blakeGuilloud/scorekeeper) package for processing a .txt file of tournament scores into a rankings list.

The front end was built with ReactJS and the API was done utilizing a serverless architecture via Lambda, API Gateway, and S3.
